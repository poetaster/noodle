# noodle
Noodle is a wandering sequencer for eurorack implemented with CMOS.

Current gerbers are confirmed from production and work well.

## overview
Noodle uses a classic shift register (4015) combined with an analog mux (4051 x 2) to produces sequences. You can dial in up to 5 notes and 3 slots are repeats of 3 tuned notes. The 'record' input (or button) with cause a toggle of the 'current' state of the slot in the 4015 which will make a select on the 4051. It noodles along.

If you connect gates to rec '][' input and they are out of sync withe clk (whether internal or external) you can get a really nice wandering selection of the notes you've dialled in. 

The gate ']['. out is obviously also wandering and is one of the 8 outputs not directly making selections on the mux a/b/c inputs. Hence, it will overlap but not always. This is nice to drive VCA gates slightly out of sync with notes. Think slightly off fadein/fadeout.
